# MIPS Single Cycled Processor

This project implements a MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) processor using a single-cycle architecture.
The project is written in VHDL and designed to run on a Basys 3 FPGA.

## Branch: MIPS_Single_Cycled

This branch (`MIPS_Single_Cycled`) contains the implementation of the MIPS processor using a single-cycle architecture.
If you're interested in the MIPS pipeline version, please check the (`MIPS_Pipeline`). :)
