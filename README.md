# MIPS Pipeline Processor

This project implements a MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) processor using a pipelined architecture.
The project is written in VHDL and designed to run on a Basys 3 FPGA.

## Branch: MIPS_Pipeline

This branch `MIPS_Pipeline` contains the implementation of the MIPS processor using a pipelined architecture.
If you're interested in the single-cycle version, please check the `MIPS_Single_Cycled` branch. :)
